Code review -- let's take a look.


Lightening talks
================

Todayâ€™s lightening talks will be from:





Strings
=======

.. rst-class:: left

Quick review: a string literal creates a string type:

.. code-block:: python

    "this is a string"

    'So is this'

    "And maybe y'all need something like this!"

    """and this also"""

.. rst-class:: left

You can also use ``str()``

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [256]: str(34)
    Out[256]: '34'

String Manipulation
-------------------

``split`` and ``join``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [167]: csv = "comma, separated, values"
    In [168]: csv.split(', ')
    Out[168]: ['comma', 'separated', 'values']
    In [169]: psv = '|'.join(csv.split(', '))
    In [170]: psv
    Out[170]: 'comma|separated|values'

Case Switching
--------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [171]: sample = 'A long string of words'
    In [172]: sample.upper()
    Out[172]: 'A LONG STRING OF WORDS'
    In [173]: sample.lower()
    Out[173]: 'a long string of words'
    In [174]: sample.swapcase()
    Out[174]: 'a LONG STRING OF WORDS'
    In [175]: sample.title()
    Out[175]: 'A Long String Of Words'

Testing
-------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [181]: number = "12345"
    In [182]: number.isnumeric()
    Out[182]: True
    In [183]: number.isalnum()
    Out[183]: True
    In [184]: number.isalpha()
    Out[184]: False
    In [185]: fancy = "Th!$ $tr!ng h@$ $ymb0l$"
    In [186]: fancy.isalnum()
    Out[186]: False

String Literals
-----------------

Common Escape Sequences::

    \\  Backslash (\)
    \a  ASCII Bell (BEL)
    \b  ASCII Backspace (BS)
    \n  ASCII Linefeed (LF)
    \r  ASCII Carriage Return (CR)
    \t  ASCII Horizontal Tab (TAB)
    \ooo  Character with octal value ooo
    \xhh  Character with hex value hh

for example -- for tab-separted values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: s = "these\tare\tseparated\tby\ttabs"

    In [26]: print(s)
    these   are separated    by  tabs

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

Raw Strings
------------

Add an ``r`` in front of the string literal:

Escape Sequences Ignored

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [408]: print("this\nthat")
    this
    that
    In [409]: print(r"this\nthat")
    this\nthat

**Gotcha**

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [415]: r"\"
    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

(handy for regex, windows paths...)

Ordinal values
--------------

Characters in strings are stored as numeric values:

* "ASCII" values: 1-127

* Unicode values -- 1 - 1,114,111 (!!!)

To get the value:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [109]: for i in 'Chris':
       .....:     print(ord(i), end=' ')
    67 104 114 105 115
    In [110]: for i in (67,104,114,105,115):
       .....:     print(chr(i), end='')
    Chris

(these days, stick with ASCII, or use full Unicode: more on that in a few weeks)

Building Strings
----------------

You can, but please don't do this:

.. code-block:: python

    'Hello ' + name + '!'

(I know -- we did that in the grid_printing excercise)

Do this instead:

.. code-block:: python

    'Hello {}!'.format(name)

It's much faster and safer, and easier to modify as code gets complicated.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting

Old and New string formatting
-----------------------------

back in early python days, there was the string formatting operator: ``%``

.. code-block:: python

    " a string: %s and a number: %i "%("text", 45)

This is very similar to C-style string formatting (`sprintf`).

It's still around, and handy --- but ...

The "new" ``format()`` method is more powerful and flexible, so we'll focus on that in this class.

.. nextslide:: String Formatting

The string ``format()`` method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [62]: "A decimal integer is: {:d}".format(34)
    Out[62]: 'A decimal integer is: 34'

    In [63]: "a floating point is: {:f}".format(34.5)
    Out[63]: 'a floating point is: 34.500000'

    In [64]: "a string is the default: {}".format("anything")
    Out[64]: 'a string is the default: anything'

Multiple placeholders
---------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [65]: "the number is {} is {}".format('five', 5)
    Out[65]: 'the number is five is 5'

    In [66]: "the first 3 numbers are {}, {}, {}".format(1,2,3)
    Out[66]: 'the first 3 numbers are 1, 2, 3'

The counts must agree:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [67]: "string with {} formatting {}".format(1)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-67-a079bc472aca> in <module>()
    ----> 1 "string with {} formatting {}".format(1)

    IndexError: tuple index out of range

Named placeholders
------------------

.. code-block:: ipython


    In [69]: "Hello, {name}, whaddaya know?".format(name="Joe")
    Out[69]: 'Hello, Joe, whaddaya know?'

You can use values more than once, and skip values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [73]: "Hi, {name}. Howzit, {name}?".format(name='Bob')
    Out[73]: 'Hi, Bob. Howzit, Bob?'

.. nextslide::

The format operator works with string variables, too:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [80]: s = "{:d} / {:d} = {:f}"

    In [81]: a, b = 12, 3

    In [82]: s.format(a, b, a/b)
    Out[82]: '12 / 3 = 4.000000'

So you can dynamically build a format string

Complex Formatting
------------------

There is a complete syntax for specifying all sorts of options.

It's well worth your while to spend some time getting to know this
`formatting language`_. You can accomplish a great deal just with this.

.. _formatting language: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language

``input``
---------

.. rst-class:: left

For some of the exercises, you'll need to interact with a user at the
command line.

There's a nice built in function to do this - ``input``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [85]: fred = input('type something-->')
    type something-->I've typed something

    In [86]: print(fred)
    I've typed something

This will display a prompt to the user, allowing them to input text and
allowing you to bind that input to a symbol.

Lab: String Formatting
----------------------

Let's play with these a bit:

:ref:`exercise_string_formatting`



Files
=====

Text Files

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt')
    secret_data = f.read()
    f.close()

``secret_data`` is a string

NOTE: these days, you probably need to use Unicode for text -- we'll get to that next week

.. nextslide::

Binary Files

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.bin', 'rb')
    secret_data = f.read()
    f.close()

``secret_data`` is a byte string

(with arbitrary bytes in it -- well, not arbitrary -- whatever is in the file.)

(See the ``struct``  module to unpack binary data )


.. nextslide::


File Opening Modes

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt', [mode])
    'r', 'w', 'a'
    'rb', 'wb', 'ab'
    r+, w+, a+
    r+b, w+b, a+b


These follow the Unix conventions, and aren't all that well documented
in the Python docs. But these BSD docs make it pretty clear:

http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/fopen/

**Gotcha** -- 'w' modes always clear the file

.. nextslide:: Text File Notes

Text is default

  * Newlines are translated: ``\r\n -> \n``
  *   -- reading and writing!
  * Use \*nix-style in your code: ``\n``


Gotcha:

  * no difference between text and binary on \*nix
  * breaks on Windows

File Reading
------------

Reading part of a file

.. code-block:: python

    header_size = 4096
    f = open('secrets.txt')
    secret_header = f.read(header_size)
    secret_rest = f.read()
    f.close()

.. nextslide::


Common Idioms

.. code-block:: python

    for line in open('secrets.txt'):
        print(line)

(the file object is an iterator!)

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt')
    while True:
        line = f.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        do_something_with_line()

.. nextslide::

We will learn more about the keyword with later, but for now, just understand
the syntax and the advantage over the try-finally block:

.. code-block:: python

 with open('workfile', 'r') as f:
     read_data = f.read()
 f.closed
 True

File Writing
------------

.. code-block:: python

    outfile = open('output.txt', 'w')
    for i in range(10):
        outfile.write("this is line: %i\n"%i)
    outfile.close()

    with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
        for i in range(10):
           f.write("this is line: %i\n"%i)

File Methods
------------

Commonly Used Methods

.. code-block:: python

    f.read() f.readline()  f.readlines()

    f.write(str) f.writelines(seq)

    f.seek(offset)   f.tell() # for binary files, mostly

    f.close()

Stream IO
---------

.. code-block:: python

    In [417]: import io
    In [420]: f = io.StringIO()
    In [421]: f.write("somestuff")
    In [422]: f.seek(0)
    In [423]: f.read()
    Out[423]: 'somestuff'
    Out[424]: stuff = f.getvalue()
    Out[425]: f.close()

(handy for testing file handling code...)

There is also cStringIO -- a bit faster.

.. code-block:: python

    from cStringIO import StringIO

Paths
-----

Paths are generally handled with simple strings (or Unicode strings)

Relative paths:

.. code-block:: python

    'secret.txt'
    './secret.txt'

Absolute paths:

.. code-block:: python

    '/home/chris/secret.txt'


Either work with ``open()`` , etc.

(working directory only makes sense with command-line programs...)

os module
----------

.. code-block:: python

    os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(path)
    os.path.abspath()
    os.path.relpath()


.. nextslide:: os.path module

.. code-block:: python

    os.path.split()
    os.path.splitext()
    os.path.basename()
    os.path.dirname()
    os.path.join()


(all platform independent)

.. nextslide:: directories

.. code-block:: python

    os.listdir()
    os.mkdir()
    os.walk()

(higher level stuff in ``shutil``  module)

pathlib
-------

``pathlib`` is a package for handling paths in an OO way:

http://pathlib.readthedocs.org/en/pep428/

All the stuff in os.path and more:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [64]: import pathlib
    In [65]: pth = pathlib.Path('./')
    In [66]: pth.is_dir()
    Out[66]: True
    In [67]: pth.absolute()
    Out[67]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris/PythonStuff/UWPCE/IntroPython2015')
    In [68]: for f in pth.iterdir():
                 print(f)
    junk2.txt
    junkfile.txt
    ...

Lab: Files
----------

In the class repo, in:

``Examples\students.txt``

You will find the list I generated of all the students in the class, and
what programming languages they have used in the past.

Write a little script that reads that file, and generates a list of all
the languages that have been used.

Extra credit: keep track of how many students specified each language.





Homework
=========

Catch up!
---------

* Finish the LABs from today

* Catch up from last week.

  - Add Exception handling to mailroom
  - and add some tests
  - and list (and dict, and set) comprehensions...

* If you've done all that -- check out the collections module:

  - https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/collections.html
  - here's a good overview: https://pymotw.com/3/collections/


Paths and File Processing
--------------------------

* write a program which prints the full path to all files in the current
  directory, one per line

* write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination
  (without using shutil, or the OS copy command)

  - advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. don't read the entire
    contents of the file into memory at once.

  - Note that if you want it to do any kind of file, you need to open the files in binary mode:
    ``open(filename, 'rb')`` (or ``'wb'`` for writing.)

* update mailroom from last week to:

  - Use dicts where appropriate
  - Write a full set of letters to everyone to individual files on disk
  - See if you can use a dict to switch between the users selections
  - Try to use a dict and the .format() method to do the letter as one
    big template -- rather than building up a big string in parts.


Material to review before next week
-----------------------------------

 * Dive into Python3: 7.2 -- 7.3
   http://www.diveintopython3.net/iterators.html#defining-classes

 * Think Pyhton: 15 -- 18
   http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython016.html

 * LPTHW: 40 -- 44
   http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html

[Note that in py3 you don't need to inherit from object]
